     ‘grep’, ‘grepl’, ‘regexpr’, ‘gregexpr’, ‘regexec’ and ‘gregexec’
     search for matches to argument ‘pattern’ within each element of a
     character vector: they differ in the format of and amount of
     detail in the results.

     ‘sub’ and ‘gsub’ perform replacement of the first and all matches
     respectively.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 pattern: character string containing a regular expression (or
          character string for ‘fixed = TRUE’) to be matched in the
          given character vector.  Coerced by ‘as.character’ to a
          character string if possible.  If a character vector of
          length 2 or more is supplied, the first element is used with
          a warning.  Missing values are allowed except for ‘regexpr’,
          ‘gregexpr’ and ‘regexec’.

 x, text: a character vector where matches are sought, or an object
          which can be coerced by ‘as.character’ to a character vector.
          Long vectors are supported.

ignore.case: if ‘FALSE’, the pattern matching is _case sensitive_ and
          if ‘TRUE’, case is ignored during matching.

    perl: logical.  Should Perl-compatible regexps be used?

   value: if ‘FALSE’, a vector containing the (‘integer’) indices of
          the matches determined by ‘grep’ is returned, and if ‘TRUE’,
          a vector containing the matching elements themselves is
          returned.

   fixed: logical.  If ‘TRUE’, ‘pattern’ is a string to be matched as
          is.  Overrides all conflicting arguments.

useBytes: logical.  If ‘TRUE’ the matching is done byte-by-byte rather
          than character-by-character.  See ‘Details’.

  invert: logical.  If ‘TRUE’ return indices or values for elements
          that do _not_ match.

replacement: a replacement for matched pattern in ‘sub’ and ‘gsub’.
          Coerced to character if possible.  For ‘fixed = FALSE’ this
          can include backreferences ‘"\1"’ to ‘"\9"’ to parenthesized
          subexpressions of ‘pattern’.  For ‘perl = TRUE’ only, it can
          also contain ‘"\U"’ or ‘"\L"’ to convert the rest of the
          replacement to upper or lower case and ‘"\E"’ to end case
          conversion.  If a character vector of length 2 or more is
          supplied, the first element is used with a warning.  If ‘NA’,
          all elements in the result corresponding to matches will be
          set to ‘NA’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Arguments which should be character strings or character vectors
     are coerced to character if possible.

     Each of these functions operates in one of three modes:

       1. ‘fixed = TRUE’: use exact matching.

       2. ‘perl = TRUE’: use Perl-style regular expressions.

       3. ‘fixed = FALSE, perl = FALSE’: use POSIX 1003.2 extended
          regular expressions (the default).

     See the help pages on regular expression for details of the
     different types of regular expressions.

     The two ‘*sub’ functions differ only in that ‘sub’ replaces only
     the first occurrence of a ‘pattern’ whereas ‘gsub’ replaces all
     occurrences.  If ‘replacement’ contains backreferences which are
     not defined in ‘pattern’ the result is undefined (but most often
     the backreference is taken to be ‘""’).

     For ‘regexpr’, ‘gregexpr’, ‘regexec’ and ‘gregexec’ it is an error
     for ‘pattern’ to be ‘NA’, otherwise ‘NA’ is permitted and gives an
     ‘NA’ match.

     Both ‘grep’ and ‘grepl’ take missing values in ‘x’ as not matching
     a non-missing ‘pattern’.

     The main effect of ‘useBytes = TRUE’ is to avoid errors/warnings
     about invalid inputs and spurious matches in multibyte locales,
     but for ‘regexpr’ it changes the interpretation of the output.  It
     inhibits the conversion of inputs with marked encodings, and is
     forced if any input is found which is marked as ‘"bytes"’ (see
     ‘Encoding’).

     Caseless matching does not make much sense for bytes in a
     multibyte locale, and you should expect it only to work for ASCII
     characters if ‘useBytes = TRUE’.

     ‘regexpr’ and ‘gregexpr’ with ‘perl = TRUE’ allow Python-style
     named captures, but not for _long vector_ inputs.

     Invalid inputs in the current locale are warned about up to 5
     times.

     Caseless matching with ‘perl = TRUE’ for non-ASCII characters
     depends on the PCRE library being compiled with ‘Unicode property
     support’, which PCRE2 is by default.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     ‘grep(value = FALSE)’ returns a vector of the indices of the
     elements of ‘x’ that yielded a match (or not, for ‘invert =
     TRUE’).  This will be an integer vector unless the input is a
     _long vector_, when it will be a double vector.

     ‘grep(value = TRUE)’ returns a character vector containing the
     selected elements of ‘x’ (after coercion, preserving names but no
     other attributes).

     ‘grepl’ returns a logical vector (match or not for each element of
     ‘x’).

     ‘sub’ and ‘gsub’ return a character vector of the same length and
     with the same attributes as ‘x’ (after possible coercion to
     character).  Elements of character vectors ‘x’ which are not
     substituted will be returned unchanged (including any declared
     encoding).  If ‘useBytes = FALSE’ a non-ASCII substituted result
     will often be in UTF-8 with a marked encoding (e.g., if there is a
     UTF-8 input, and in a multibyte locale unless ‘fixed = TRUE’).
     Such strings can be re-encoded by ‘enc2native’.

     ‘regexpr’ returns an integer vector of the same length as ‘text’
     giving the starting position of the first match or -1 if there is
     none, with attribute ‘"match.length"’, an integer vector giving
     the length of the matched text (or -1 for no match).  The match
     positions and lengths are in characters unless ‘useBytes = TRUE’
     is used, when they are in bytes (as they are for ASCII-only
     matching: in either case an attribute ‘useBytes’ with value ‘TRUE’
     is set on the result).  If named capture is used there are further
     attributes ‘"capture.start"’, ‘"capture.length"’ and
     ‘"capture.names"’.

     ‘gregexpr’ returns a list of the same length as ‘text’ each
     element of which is of the same form as the return value for
     ‘regexpr’, except that the starting positions of every (disjoint)
     match are given.

     ‘regexec’ returns a list of the same length as ‘text’ each element
     of which is either -1 if there is no match, or a sequence of
     integers with the starting positions of the match and all
     substrings corresponding to parenthesized subexpressions of
     ‘pattern’, with attribute ‘"match.length"’ a vector giving the
     lengths of the matches (or -1 for no match).  The interpretation
     of positions and length and the attributes follows ‘regexpr’.

     ‘gregexec’ returns the same as ‘regexec’, except that to
     accommodate multiple matches per element of ‘text’, the integer
     sequences for each match are made into columns of a matrix, with
     one matrix per element of ‘text’ with matches.

     Where matching failed because of resource limits (especially for
     ‘perl = TRUE’) this is regarded as a non-match, usually with a
     warning.

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g:

     The POSIX 1003.2 mode of ‘gsub’ and ‘gregexpr’ does not work
     correctly with repeated word-boundaries (e.g., ‘pattern = "\b"’).
     Use ‘perl = TRUE’ for such matches (but that may not work as
     expected with non-ASCII inputs, as the meaning of ‘word’ is
     system-dependent).

_P_e_r_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e _c_o_n_s_i_d_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_s:

     If you are doing a lot of regular expression matching, including
     on very long strings, you will want to consider the options used.
     Generally ‘perl = TRUE’ will be faster than the default regular
     expression engine, and ‘fixed = TRUE’ faster still (especially
     when each pattern is matched only a few times).

     If you are working in a single-byte locale and have marked UTF-8
     strings that are representable in that locale, convert them first
     as just one UTF-8 string will force all the matching to be done in
     Unicode, which attracts a penalty of around 3x for the default
     POSIX 1003.2 mode.

     If you can make use of ‘useBytes = TRUE’, the strings will not be
     checked before matching, and the actual matching will be faster.
     Often byte-based matching suffices in a UTF-8 locale since byte
     patterns of one character never match part of another.  Character
     ranges may produce unexpected results.

     PCRE-based matching by default used to put additional effort into
     ‘studying’ the compiled pattern when ‘x’/‘text’ has length 10 or
     more.  That study may use the PCRE JIT compiler on platforms where
     it is available (see ‘pcre_config’). As from PCRE2 (PCRE version
     >= 10.00 as reported by ‘extSoftVersion’), there is no study
     phase, but the patterns are optimized automatically when possible,
     and PCRE JIT is used when enabled.  The details are controlled by
     ‘options’ ‘PCRE_study’ and ‘PCRE_use_JIT’.  (Some timing
     comparisons can be seen by running file ‘tests/PCRE.R’ in the R
     sources (and perhaps installed).)  People working with PCRE and
     very long strings can adjust the maximum size of the JIT stack by
     setting environment variable ‘R_PCRE_JIT_STACK_MAXSIZE’ before JIT
     is used to a value between ‘1’ and ‘1000’ in MB: the default is
     ‘64’. When JIT is not used with PCRE version < 10.30 (that is with
     PCRE1 and old versions of PCRE2), it might also be wise to set the
     option ‘PCRE_limit_recursion’.

_N_o_t_e:

     Aspects will be platform-dependent as well as local-dependent: for
     example the implementation of character classes (except
     ‘[:digit:]’ and ‘[:xdigit:]’).  One can expect results to be
     consistent for ASCII inputs and when working in UTF-8 mode (when
     most platforms will use Unicode character tables, although those
     are updated frequently and subject to some degree of
     interpretation - is a circled capital letter alphabetic or a
     symbol?).  However, results in 8-bit encodings can differ
     considerably between platforms, modes and from the UTF-8 versions.

_S_o_u_r_c_e:

     The C code for POSIX-style regular expression matching has changed
     over the years.  As from R 2.10.0 (Oct 2009) the TRE library of
     Ville Laurikari (<URL: https://github.com/laurikari/tre>) is used.
     The POSIX standard does give some room for interpretation,
     especially in the handling of invalid regular expressions and the
     collation of character ranges, so the results will have changed
     slightly over the years.

     For Perl-style matching PCRE2 or PCRE (<URL:
     https://www.pcre.org>) is used: again the results may depend
     (slightly) on the version of PCRE in use.
